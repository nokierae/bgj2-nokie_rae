# Bevy Game Jam 2 - Nokie Rae

## Game

Remember the roguelike where you draft the dungeon? So one of the ideas was to draft "choices" about the run. Say you only need to get 3 runes, which 3 bosses did you fight to get them could be part of those choices. The minions of those bosses will act differently if their leader is dead. Will they run away? Will they go on a blood frenzy against anything and everything? Will the highest ranked leuitenant send out powerful invisible ninjas to hunt you down?

It would also affect the loot you have access to, and the remaining bosses that have their full power to send minions after you. So you are also lessening threats, but choosing others to fight through to the surface.
